# Data dictionary

Eight files in `raw/`, exactly as published: no renamed columns, no type conversion, no date fixing, no deduplication, no blank filling. Everything below describes the files **as they are**, not as they should be. Where a definition and the data disagree, the data wins; note the disagreement in your report.

| File | Grain | Rows | Window |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fdic_institutions.json` | One row per FDIC-insured institution, ever | 27,835 | All history |
| `fdic_financials.csv` | One row per institution per quarter-end | 523,136 | 2006 Q1 to 2026 Q2 |
| `fdic_failures.csv` | One row per failure or assistance transaction | 4,117 | 1934 onward |
| `cfpb_complaints.csv` | One row per complaint | 1,077,624 | Received 2019-01-01 to 2026-06-30 |
| `fred_FEDFUNDS.csv` | One row per month | 867 | 1954 onward |
| `fred_UNRATE.csv` | One row per month | 945 | 1948 onward |
| `fred_MORTGAGE30US.csv` | One row per week | 2,898 | 1971 onward |
| `fred_DGS10.csv` | One row per trading day | 16,898 | 1962 onward |

Conventions that apply across the FDIC files:

- **Dollar amounts are in thousands of dollars.**
- **`CERT`** is the FDIC certificate number and the key that links institutions, financials and failures. It is a number in the JSON file and a text column in the CSVs.
- Income-statement fields in the financials are **year-to-date**, not for the quarter (see that file's notes).
- Ratios are percentages, already multiplied by 100 (`ROA` of `1.2` means 1.2 percent).

## `fdic_institutions.json`

The FDIC's directory of every institution it has ever insured. The file is a JSON array of records shaped `{"data": {...}, "score": 1}`; the fields below live inside `data`. A field that is null for an institution is absent from that record rather than present with a null value.

## `fdic_financials.csv`

Quarterly figures from the Call Reports that every insured institution files. One row per institution per quarter-end. Columns are in the order the API returned them, which is not the order below.

**Year-to-date, not quarterly.** `NETINC`, `INTINC`, `EINTEXP`, `NONII`, `NONIX` and `ELNATR` accumulate through the calendar year: the 30 September row holds January to September, and the 31 December row holds the full year.
